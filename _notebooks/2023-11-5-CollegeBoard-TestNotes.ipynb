    "# College Board Final Test Reflection\n",
    "The test was difficult, but not impossible. Because I was given ample time to complete the assessment and was granted access to the internet and notes, I managed to achieve a good score. However, the task was arduous and time-consuming. I was surprised by the absence of code-related questions; most problems were indicative of problem-solving and recalling key terminology taught in the course."

    "## Citizen science\n",
    "Citizen science is when the public voluntarily helps conduct scientific research. Citizen scientists may design experiments, collect data, analyze results, and solve problems. In national parks, most citizen scientists collect data with tools provided by project directors.\n",

    "The digital divide is the unequal access to digital technology, including smartphones, tablets, laptops, and the internet. The digital divide creates a division and inequality around access to information and resources.\n",

    "Unreasonable time: Algorithms with exponential or factorial efficiencies are examples of algorithms that run in an unreasonable amount of time. Reasonable time: Algorithms with a polynomial efficiency or lower (constant, linear, square, cube, etc.) are said to run in a reasonable amount of time.\n",

    "## Symmetric Encryption\n",
    "Symmetric encryption is a type of encryption where only one key (a secret key) is used to both encrypt and decrypt electronic data. The entities communicating via symmetric encryption must exchange the key so that it can be used in the decryption process."
