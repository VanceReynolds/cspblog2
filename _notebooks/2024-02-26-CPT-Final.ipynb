    "Project Overview:\n",
    "My teams project breaks down the popular mobile game \"Clash Royale\", each team member created a unique feautre relating to an aspect of the game. This includes databases displaying user information, tournaments, news, simulations of deck creation and chest openings and top decks on the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "My Feature:\n",
    "My feature displays data collected at official clash royale tournaments in a user interactive format. The user can see the top decks in the current meta and sort through them based off of data such as popularity and win percentage. This feature provides valuable insight into deck building, as a precursor for experienced and new players to Dante's and Ashwin's features. I had a second feature in the works for a while that was never finished, it worked in tandem with Gershawn's feature pulling data from the official clash royale database. The purpose was to retrieve clan and player information and displaying it for the user to search through, I spent many hours before and during break, attempting to get the data to pull and display but with much troubleshooting and attempts to reach out to my peers for assistance my second feature ultimately fell through. In addition to my feature, I put in extensive effort in to my groups team teach, and frontend design, I helped construct the frontend visuals and layout of the site.\n",
