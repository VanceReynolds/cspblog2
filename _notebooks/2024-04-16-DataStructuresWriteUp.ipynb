    "## What Is Clash Royale?\n",
    "Clash Royale is a popular RTS top down mobile game. The game has cards for each troop which can deployed onto the battlefield strategically to defeat the enemies castle like towers. There are currently around 120 cards in the game, each card has a rarity determining stats and ease to upgrade, and elixir cost to deploy the troop, along with its stats. Rarity can vary between, common, rare, epic, ledgendary, and champion, each one increasingly rare. Different types of chests can be won from battling, giving cards to the played onces opened. Collected cards are placed into decks of 8 which can be deployed in a battle. Our enitre project followed this theme, and we created features like a deck builder, a tornament tracker, a custom survay, and a deck information page.\n",

    "## My Feature\n",
    "My primary feature displays data collected at official clash royale tournaments in a user interactive format. The user can see the top decks in the current meta and sort through them based off of data such as popularity, name, and win percentage. This feature provides valuable insight into deck building, as a precursor for experienced and new players alike to Dante's and Ashwin's features. I had a second feature in the works for a while that was never finished, it worked in tandem with Gershawn's feature pulling data from the official clash royale database. The purpose was to retrieve clan and player information and displaying it for the user to search through, I spent many hours before and during break, attempting to get the data to pull and display but with much troubleshooting and attempts to reach out to my peers for assistance my second feature ultimately fell through. In addition to my feature, I put in extensive effort in to my groups team teach, and frontend design, I helped construct the frontend visuals and layout of the site.\n",

    "- Discuss concepts and understanding of Linear Regression algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear Regression is a fundamental statistical method used to analyze and understand the relationship between a dependent variable (such as house prices) and one or more independent variables (like size or number of bedrooms). This method assumes that this relationship can be approximated by a straight line. Imagine plotting data points on a graph where the vertical axis represents the dependent variable and the horizontal axis represents the independent variable(s). Linear Regression aims to find the best-fitting line through these points by adjusting the slope and intercept of the line to minimize the difference between predicted values and actual data points. This technique is widely used in various fields such as economics, finance, and engineering to make predictions or infer relationships between variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Discuss concepts and understanding of Decision Tree analysis algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision Trees are a type of model used in machine learning and data mining for making decisions based on input features. They resemble flowchart-like structures where each internal node represents a question or a test on a specific feature, each branch represents the possible answer or outcome of the test, and each leaf node represents a final decision or classification. Decision Trees are used for both classification and regression tasks and are particularly useful for understanding the underlying patterns in data. They can handle both numerical and categorical data and are capable of capturing complex relationships between variables, making them versatile for various applications such as customer segmentation, fraud detection, and medical diagnosis."
