    "## What Is Clash Royale?\n",
    "Clash Royale is a popular RTS top down mobile game. The game has cards for each troop which can deployed onto the battlefield strategically to defeat the enemies castle like towers. There are currently around 120 cards in the game, each card has a rarity determining stats and ease to upgrade, and elixir cost to deploy the troop, along with its stats. Rarity can vary between, common, rare, epic, ledgendary, and champion, each one increasingly rare. Different types of chests can be won from battling, giving cards to the played onces opened. Collected cards are placed into decks of 8 which can be deployed in a battle. Our enitre project followed this theme, and we created features like a deck builder, a tornament tracker, a custom survay, and a deck information page.\n",
    "\n",
    "## My Feature\n",
    "My primary feature displays data collected at official clash royale tournaments in a user interactive format. The user can see the top decks in the current meta and sort through them based off of data such as popularity, name, and win percentage. This feature provides valuable insight into deck building, as a precursor for experienced and new players alike to Dante's and Ashwin's features. I had a second feature in the works for a while that was never finished, it worked in tandem with my teammate Gershawn's feature pulling data from the official clash royale database. The purpose was to retrieve clan and player information and displaying it for the user to search through, I spent many hours before and during break, attempting to get the data to pull and display but with much troubleshooting and attempts to reach out to my peers for assistance my second feature ultimately fell through. In addition to my feature, I put in extensive effort in to my groups team teach, and frontend design, I helped construct the frontend visuals and layout of the site.\n",
