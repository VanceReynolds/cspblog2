# Passion Project Reflection

AGILE:
Agile was extremely useful when working on the passion project it allowed everyone to work independantly but at the same time similtaneously working toward a single goal. Agile made sure everyone made comits and changes, making sure everyone contributed to the project. Additionaly, AGILE made programming simple as I can build off other peopleâ€™s code and they can build off mine.

Project Timeline:
Plan
Design
Frontend Repo and Backend Repo Created
Backend API is created
Backend Localhost Test/Commit Backend Design
Deploy Backend to AWS 
Finalize Frontend Design
Connect Backend to Frontend
Repeat steps and troubleshoot!

TroubleShooting:
ITs always important to test locally before commiting final changes to Github Repo in case the build is broken by your code. Use built in debugger when involving code cells. Finaly, add comments to you code cells to make sure you and your team understand the code that is being displayed, this ensures you can return to it later and make changes.
