# Trimester 1 Reflection

Reflecting on the first trimester of CSP, I am filled with a sense of accomplishment and growth. A highlight of this term was undoubtedly the passion project, where I chose to create a Pokedex. Through its construction I honed my problem-solving and project management skills. In terms of programming languages, I delved into Python and JavaScript, mastering their fundamentals, in the future I'd like to take a deeper look at language and learn more complex usage of them. Throughout these twelve weeks I've also learned to navigate VS Code which proved invaluable in streamlining my workflow and making coding more efficient. VS Code made colaboration with my team members simple and easy. Additionally, learning Markdown enhanced my document formatting and website building, allowing me to add complex visuals and interactive elements to my Pokedex. As I look ahead, I am eager to deepen my understanding of Python and JS and embark on new adventures like the Passion Project.
