## Our Thoughts

- The idea is to create a Batman-themed entry incorporating everything we've learned in the course thus far. We plan to display our knowledge of Python, Java, Markdown, etc.
- The project might include information about the character, statistics using tables, embedded images, possibly a video made by us, and a custom Batman-themed game.
- The Batman game: We plan to use Space Invaders, so that we don't have to code everything from scratch. We will take the code and change the display. We haven't fully decided what it will be, but an example might be the Batmobile in the streets of Gotham, fighting an onslaught of enemy vehicles.
