[Debugging Issue](https://github.com/VanceReynolds/cspblog2/issues/8)

Debugging event reflection: For my work I recieved a 1.8 out of 2, the assignment proved to be a valuable learning experience. Beginning by setting breakpoints and navigating through the source code, I gained crucial insight into the flow of execution and identified potential issues effectively. Learning Split-screen debugging, and finding issues in frontend and backend, and steping through breakpoints is going to be useful when finding future issues.
