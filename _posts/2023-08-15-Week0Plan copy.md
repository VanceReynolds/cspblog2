## Journal
Not much happened in the first week, I interacted with my new classmates and found that some of my friends were in my class. We were instructed to find a parter to preset an about me drawing to, this task was unexpectedly difficult. Not the finding a partner part, that was easy. Drawing with my finger on a tiny screen was torture. The final result definetely reflects how hard it was.
