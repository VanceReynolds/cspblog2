## My Strugles

- After creating a new repository and setting up a new GitHub Pages website, the theme I had selected in the config.yml file didn't display properly. After troubleshooting, I discovered that the repository's name was incorrect in my config.yml. I corrected the name, but the issue persisted, I visited GitHub and initiated a new deployment. After which I executed the commands "make stop," "make clear," and "make." in my VScode resolving the problem.
