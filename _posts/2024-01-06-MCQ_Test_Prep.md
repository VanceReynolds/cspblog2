# Test Preperation

The Internet:
I revisited past team teaches, particularly for explanations detailing the historical progression from ARPANET to the contemporary web. Additionally, I interacted with my the team, promptly seeking focused clarifications on technical aspects.

Routing and Computing:
For Routing and Computing I discussed with my peers, went over the college board videos and reviewed data packet transmission across networks. I also participated in Q&A sessions with my team, concentrating on key algorithms and computational thinking.

Internetâ€™s Dual Nature:
To quickly comprehend the Internet's dual nature, I participated in expedited discussions with its creators, seeking concise insights into both benefits and risks. I read over an online short documentary, concentrating on cybersecurity threats and privacy concerns.

Safe Computing: Read government article about cybersecurity.

Digital Divide:
My team did the digital divide so I was well versed on this topic and didn't need to do much review, I looked over my teams work on our team teach briefly to review. 

Computing Bias:
This topic wasnt too difficult to understand so I once again just looked over the team teach and googled any terms I did not understand.

Undecided Problems:
Review was fairly straight forward, I reviewed the halting problem as I didn't fully understand it at the time of the team teach and the popcorn hacks present by the team teach. The takeaway being the halting problem determines, a description of an arbitrary computer program and an input, whether the program will finish running, or continue to run forever.

 Crowdsourcing:
 To review crowdsourcing I watched a harvard youtube video about it and its benefits. Some benefits included unexpected solutions to tough problems, greater diversity of thinking, reduced management burden, marketing buzz, faster problem solving, customer-centric data, and diversity.
